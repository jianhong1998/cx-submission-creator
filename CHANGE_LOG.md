## 2025-07-20 - Initial Project Setup & Documentation

### Project Initialization
- **Repository Created**: Initialized git repository with main branch
- **Project Structure**: Established Customer Experience (CX) submission creator project
- **Core Technology**: NestJS-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server

### NestJS Application Setup (cx-mcp-server)
- **Framework**: NestJS v11 with TypeScript ES2023
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI integration at `/docs` endpoint
- **Validation System**: Global DTO validation with class-validator and class-transformer
- **Development Features**: Hot reload and watch mode support
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22

### Docker Development Environment
- **Containerization**: Development-optimized Docker setup
- **Base Image**: node:22-alpine for lightweight development
- **File Watching**: Automatic sync for source code changes in `cx-mcp-server/src`
- **Auto-restart**: Application restarts on package.json changes
- **Port Configuration**: Configurable via APP_PORT environment variable (default: 3001)

### Development Tooling
- **Build System**: Makefile with common development commands
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier integration
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with unit, watch, coverage, and e2e test modes
- **Environment Management**: .env file configuration

### Documentation & AI Assistance
- **CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive development guide for AI code assistants
  - Common development commands (Docker and NestJS workflows)
  - Architecture overview and project structure
  - Development workflow guidance
  - Key configuration details
- **README.md**: Complete project documentation with setup instructions
- **TASK.md**: Original project requirements and implementation tasks

### Key Features Implemented
- **API Server**: RESTful API with automatic request/response validation
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI for API testing and exploration
- **Development Workflow**: Streamlined Docker-based development environment
- **Code Standards**: Consistent TypeScript configuration with strict validation

### AI Model Context
This project serves as a foundation for Customer Experience data handling and submissions. The architecture supports:
- Scalable NestJS application structure
- DTO-based data validation and transformation
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Development environment automation
- Code quality enforcement through linting and formatting

All development commands are accessible through the Makefile, with Docker Compose managing the development environment for consistent cross-platform development.
