This file documents the project's development history and changes for AI model understanding.

## 2025-07-20 - Initial Project Setup & Documentation

### Project Initialization
- **Repository Created**: Initialized git repository with main branch
- **Project Structure**: Established Customer Experience (CX) submission creator project
- **Core Technology**: NestJS-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server

### NestJS Application Setup (cx-mcp-server)
- **Framework**: NestJS v11 with TypeScript ES2023
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI integration at `/docs` endpoint
- **Validation System**: Global DTO validation with class-validator and class-transformer
- **Development Features**: Hot reload and watch mode support
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22

### Docker Development Environment
- **Containerization**: Development-optimized Docker setup
- **Base Image**: node:22-alpine for lightweight development
- **File Watching**: Automatic sync for source code changes in `cx-mcp-server/src`
- **Auto-restart**: Application restarts on package.json changes
- **Port Configuration**: Configurable via APP_PORT environment variable (default: 3001)

### Development Tooling
- **Build System**: Makefile with common development commands
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier integration
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with unit, watch, coverage, and e2e test modes
- **Environment Management**: .env file configuration

### Documentation & AI Assistance
- **CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive development guide for AI code assistants
  - Common development commands (Docker and NestJS workflows)
  - Architecture overview and project structure
  - Development workflow guidance
  - Key configuration details
- **README.md**: Complete project documentation with setup instructions
- **TASK.md**: Original project requirements and implementation tasks

### Key Features Implemented
- **API Server**: RESTful API with automatic request/response validation
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI for API testing and exploration
- **Development Workflow**: Streamlined Docker-based development environment
- **Code Standards**: Consistent TypeScript configuration with strict validation

### AI Model Context
This project serves as a foundation for Customer Experience data handling and submissions. The architecture supports:
- Scalable NestJS application structure
- DTO-based data validation and transformation
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Development environment automation
- Code quality enforcement through linting and formatting

All development commands are accessible through the Makefile, with Docker Compose managing the development environment for consistent cross-platform development.

## 2025-07-29 - Major Refactoring: External Services Module Architecture

### Module Structure Refactoring
- **Module Rename**: Renamed `project-team-builder` module to `external-services` for better scalability
- **Service Rename**: Renamed `ProjectTeamBuilderService` to `UserAccountService` for clearer functionality description
- **Method Rename**: Renamed `getAccountLicenses()` method to `getUserAccountLicenses()` for improved clarity
- **Architecture Improvement**: Restructured to support multiple external service integrations

### Enhanced Modularity
- **Scalable Design**: New external-services module provides a foundation for integrating with multiple external APIs
- **Generic Naming**: Service and method names now reflect their actual purpose (user account management) rather than specific implementation details
- **Future-Ready**: Architecture now supports easy addition of new external service integrations

### Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated to reflect new module structure and external services architecture
- **README.md**: Updated project description and MCP tools documentation
- **SPEC.md**: Updated business requirements to reference new service structure
- **TASK.md**: Updated implementation tasks to use new service and method names
- **Import Updates**: All imports and references updated throughout the codebase

### Technical Improvements
- **Consistent Naming**: All service, module, and method names now follow consistent conventions
- **Test Updates**: All test files updated to reflect new naming conventions
- **Type Safety**: Maintained strict TypeScript typing throughout refactoring
- **Code Quality**: Ensured all changes follow SOLID and DRY principles

### MCP Tool Updates
- **Tool Description**: Updated `list_users` tool description to reflect external services integration
- **Service Integration**: Tool now properly integrates with UserAccountService from external-services module
- **Scalability**: MCP tools now benefit from the modular external services architecture

This refactoring enhances the project's ability to integrate with multiple external services while maintaining clean, descriptive naming conventions and modular architecture.
